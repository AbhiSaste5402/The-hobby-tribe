**Audio Classification Project**

Welcome to my audio classification project! Within this repository, I invite you to join me on an illuminating journey through the captivating world of audio analysis driven by machine learning methodologies. This project encapsulates my exploration of classifying audio files, and it's a testament to the power of artificial intelligence in unraveling the intricate patterns within sound waves.

**Key Phases and Achievements:**

1. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Extraction:** The project's inception involved converting raw audio data into a format suitable for machine learning. Leveraging the `librosa` library, I extracted essential features like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Chroma features, Zero Crossing Rate, and Spectral Centroid. This step laid the foundation for my model to identify distinctive characteristics within the audio files.

2. **Model Construction and Training:** Armed with the extracted features, I meticulously constructed a neural network using the Keras framework. Employing a Sequential architecture, I integrated dense layers, activation functions, and dropout layers to curtail overfitting. Through rigorous training and fine-tuning, I endeavored to maximize the model's predictive accuracy.

3. **Initial Challenges and Refinement:** The early stages yielded promising training and validation accuracy; however, the model's testing accuracy posed a challenge, sparking concerns of overfitting. This pivotal juncture marked the inception of innovative solutions that would eventually elevate the model's performance.

4. **Integration of Azure AutoML:** Seeking a comprehensive solution, I embraced the capabilities of Azure AutoML. This automated machine learning platform meticulously explored diverse classification models and hyperparameters, ultimately yielding a model with remarkable outcomes. The amalgamation of manual efforts and automated optimization propelled the training accuracy to 100% and the testing accuracy to an impressive 95%.

5. **Showcase Website and Future Prospects:** Armed with an enhanced model, I translated its capabilities into practicality by crafting a showcase website. This platform enabled real-time audio classification predictions, offering users an immersive experience. While the website remains offline to circumvent operational costs, its creation underscores the versatility and impact of machine learning solutions in real-world applications.

This repository encapsulates the source code, methodologies, and insights that emanated from this dynamic exploration. It provides a comprehensive overview of the project's progression, from data preprocessing to model optimization and practical implementation.

Audio Classification Project

Welcome to my audio classification project! In this repository, I showcase my journey through the realm of audio analysis using machine learning techniques. I began by converting audio data into meaningful features and constructed a neural network model for classification. Addressing initial challenges, I integrated Azure AutoML to optimize model accuracy, resulting in impressive results. While I refrained from deploying the model to a showcase website to avoid costs, the repository encapsulates the project's codebase, methodologies, and insights gained throughout this exciting exploration. Join me as we delve into the fascinating world of audio classification and machine learning.

Key Highlights:

Data preprocessing and feature extraction
Sequential neural network architecture
Integration of Azure AutoML for hyperparameter tuning
Showcase website creation for real-time predictions
Explore the code, methodologies, and journey behind this project as we delve into the power of AI in audio analysis.
